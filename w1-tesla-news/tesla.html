BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. electric car maker Tesla (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/tesla-motors" target="_blank">TSLA</a>) cut the starting price of its Chinese-made Model 3 sedans on Thursday by about 8% to 249,900 yuan ($36,805), once Chinese subsidies for electric vehicles are taken into account, according to its China website.</p>
<p>Previously, the starting price for Model 3 sedans made in Tesla's Shanghai factory with a standard driving range was 271,550 yuan, after state purchase subsidies.</p>
<p>Sources told Reuters that the standard range Model 3 sedans would now come with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries which are cheaper than the nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cells it used previously.</p>
<p>Tesla did not disclose what batteries the cheaper version uses.</p>
<p>The price for Model 3 vehicles with a longer range is now 309,900 yuan, down from 344,050 yuan.</p>
<p>Tesla started to deliver cars from the Shanghai factory in December, helping it save on shipping costs and tariffs for imported models.</p>
<p>Tesla sold more than 11,000 vehicles, mostly Model 3s, in August in China, the world's biggest car market.</p>
<p>It is also building new car manufacturing capacity for Model Y sports-utility vehicles in Shanghai and expects to start delivering them from next year.
